# 🌐 Crowdfunding DApp (Smart Contract)

## 🧠 Project Description
The **Crowdfunding DApp** is a simple decentralized fundraising contract built on Ethereum. It allows individuals or project owners to set a funding goal and collect contributions from supporters directly in Ether (ETH). Once the goal is reached, the owner can withdraw the total funds.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a **transparent**, **secure**, and **trustless** crowdfunding solution that removes intermediaries, giving creators and innovators the freedom to raise funds directly from a global audience using blockchain technology.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Direct Contributions:** Supporters can contribute ETH directly to the campaign.
- **Goal Tracking:** The contract tracks total funds and checks if the goal has been reached.
- **Owner-Only Withdrawal:** Funds can only be withdrawn by the campaign creator after the goal is achieved.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement **refund functionality** for contributors if the goal isn’t met within a deadline.
- Add **multiple campaigns** under a single contract.
- Integrate with a **frontend DApp (React/Next.js)** for easy interaction.
- Include **event logs** for tracking contributions and withdrawals.
- Support **token-based rewards** for contributors.
